<h4>thinking in pig latin</h4>

<p>
prototyping in ruby was a great way to prove the concept but my main motivation for this project
was to play some more with pig.
</p>

<p>
the main relation we want to model is the idea of a trend ( one record per facet ).
</p>

are p's required when we paste in wordpress?!

to calculate whether a new value is trending or not we need to be able to calculate the mean and standard
deviation of the time series and there are two ways to do this;

the first is the naive way our ruby implementation has done it. 
keep track of all frequencies seen so far and recalculating as required. 
this is simple but is not constant in space (alarm bells!)

a more elegant way is to keep track of a few key components and fold new values in.

the mean at time n+1 can be calculated from the mean at time n (if you keep also keep track of n)
eg mean at time n+1 = ( (mean at time n * n) + new value ) / n+1

the standard deviation at time n+1 can be similiarly calculated if you keep track of the mean of the square of
the values.

so our main relation has the schema <pre>{key: chararray,m: double,ms: double,n: int}</pre>



steps
- load existing model
- convert next chunk into ngrams
- fold next chunk of data into model
- query model for highest trends based 

concerns
- want to model trend per ngram in constant space
- don't know at the start what ngrams we'll see in each chunk

TODO:

keep lastN values in mongo?
{ :ngram => 'cream cheese', :freqs => [12,34,56,34,56,67] }

- lookup freqs
- if size>max; then shift array and issue shift op to mongo
- append to end and issue append op to mongo

some interesting observations...

1) pretty much any of 'has given loan amount of 4500 to oasis group guerero mexico reason purchase of raw materials to make cheese' could have been trending
but i guess only 'to make' was the only 2gram that had been seen before and allowed the trend to be exposed.

TODO: how to bake this into the algo? to allow all these to have been exposed in first hit?

went well
 - prototype in ruby; develop in pig; deploy on ec2;
 - thinking in a streaming way

went poorly
 - clumsy orchestration in pig
