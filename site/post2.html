<h4>thinking in pig latin</h4>

<p>
prototyping in ruby was a great way to prove the concept but my main motivation for this project
was to play some more with pig.
</p>

<p>
the main approach will be
- maintain a relation, one record per ngram we want to keep track of.
- fold the data representing the next time slice into the model
- check the entries for the latest slice for trends
</p>

<p>
the ruby impl used the simplest approach possible for calculating mean and stddev; maintain a record of
all the values for each timeseries and recalculate the mean and std dev for each new value.
</p>

<p>
for our pig approach we can take a fixed space approach. both the mean and the standard deviation at time<sub>n+1</sub> 
are a function of n and the mean and mean of the squares at time<sub>n</sub>. 
</p>

<p>
our pig script will be run once per time slice converting the model as it was at time<sub>n</sub>
into a model for time<sub>n+1</sub>
</p>

<p>
let's work through one iteration of the processing.
</p>

<h5>load raw model</h5>

<p>
first we load the existing version of the model, this is based on 

at sensis? when i was on yellow we had you over for a future fridays session. i remember i pushed to get to guys back in to do some stuff

some interesting observations...

1) pretty much any of 'has given loan amount of 4500 to oasis group guerero mexico reason purchase of raw materials to make cheese' could have been trending
but i guess only 'to make' was the only 2gram that had been seen before and allowed the trend to be exposed.

TODO: how to bake this into the algo? to allow all these to have been exposed in first hit?

TODO: what is the end goal? we could collate these to give a score per tweet for those that match 
but is this really what we want. i want the trends, not the tweets, though it seems some analysis
on the top tweets might help decide the trends a little bit...

4. per term; mean and std dev comapred to this time previous days



retro

went well
 - prototype in ruby; develop in pig; deploy on ec2;
 - thinking in a streaming way

went poorly
 - clumsy orchestration in pig
 - ec2 emr doesnt support this idea of iterative successive pig jobs

puzzle
 - how little data cleaning can you get away with?
 - are the data cleansing steps for this project worth the effort?

actions
 - port to piglet
 - combine 1/2/3 gram trends
 - run on ec2 against gardenhose sample 
 - how to recombine overlapping trends to get uber trend?
