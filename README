trying out some simple trending algorithms

to run ruby version
bash> source rc
then see lib/run.sh for the end to end script to build all the data for generating the prj page graphs

ro run pig version
cd pig
cat run.sh for info

1) converting trending value = fraction of sd over mean worked well, need to formalise it and fold into normal version
2) need a way to properly handle the fft values. perhaps they can have an estimate mean and sd based on all terms so far and trend off that?
3) granularity problem (is there enough day to trend per hour? or have to do to day) can be solved by a sliding window approach. we keep so mean/sd calcs on a days worth of day and just fold in newest hour and fold out oldest hour to update the value.
