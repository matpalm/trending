trying out some simple trending algorithms

notes on http://matpalm.com/blog/tags/e15

TODOS:
 - ability to facet; ie trends per forum as well as overall trends
 - include ignore_punc.rb; (eg ["can","'","t"] -> ["can't"]


DATA PREP:

# need to sort by time, not id, since that's how we bucket into the timeslots
$ zcat ../tt/tt.posts.tsv.gz | head -n1000 | sort -t$'\t' -k2 -n | ../tt/extract_body.rb | split_into_chunks.rb

v1)

only consider tokens freq when it token occurs

to run ruby version
bash> source rc
then see lib/run.sh for the end to end script to build all the data for generating the prj page graphs

to run pig version
cd pig
cat run.sh for info

trending score = fraction over twice sd

v2)

combination; start considering tokens when they are first seen but from then if token is not seen then
assume zero value for that timeslice

forget about fft cases

consider trending value BEFORE folding chunk into model 
(makes huge difference to 1,2,3,2,2,3,4,20 style cases)

trending score = fraction of sd over the mean
